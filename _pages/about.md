Hi, I'm Mui. I’m an infectious disease modeler, and I like working through complex problems with quantitative tools in the hope of making the world a little better. I was born in Vietnam, grew up in Dresden, Germany, and have lived in the Netherlands, the UK, and now the United States. My work sits at the intersection of epidemiology, statistics, and public health, with a particular focus on antimicrobial resistance - how it emerges, how it spreads, and how we might slow it down through better decisions at both the clinical and population level.

I’m currently a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the University of Utah, where I work with Katharine Walter on developing statistical models to study the impact of ambient air pollution on tuberculosis and to estimate transmission bottlenecks in TB.

Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow with Yonatan Grad and Marc Lipsitch at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. My research focused on the relationship between antibiotic use and antibiotic resistance, drawing on large-scale data from the U.S. Veterans Health Administration and Alberta Health Services in Canada. I also integrated epidemiological and genomic data to distinguish transmission from importation during real-time SARS-CoV-2 outbreak investigations, using surveillance and whole-genome sequencing data from the NBA Occupational Health Program.

I completed my Ph.D. in February 2022 at the Julius Center for Health Sciences and Primary Care, University Medical Center Utrecht, under the supervision of Mirjam Kretzschmar, Martin Bootsma, and Ganna Rozhnova. My doctoral research focused on developing mathematical models of pathogen transmission, focusing on _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_ in intensive care units and SARS-CoV-2 in hospitals and secondary schools.

Outside of research, I enjoy climbing, hiking, running, discussion nights, and Lindy Hop. I was born in Vietnam, grew up in Germany, and have lived in the Netherlands, the UK, and now the United States. I tend to think of myself as a bit of a cultural potpourri, shaped by many places and communities. I’m drawn to community-centered projects, thoughtful conversations, and work that’s grounded in curiosity, care, and connection.
