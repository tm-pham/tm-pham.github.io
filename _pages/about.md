About me
======
Hi, I'm Mui. I’m an infectious disease modeler who enjoys problem-solving and using quantitative tools to make the world a tiny bit better. My work sits at the intersection of epidemiology, statistics, and public health, with a particular focus on antimicrobial resistance - how it emerges, how it spreads, and how we might slow it down through better decisions at both the clinical and population level.

I’m currently a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the University of Utah, where I work with Katharine Walter on developing statistical models to study the impact of ambient air pollution on tuberculosis and to estimate transmission bottlenecks in TB.

I completed my Ph.D. at University Medical Center Utrecht in the Netherlands, where I developed mathematical models to study the transmission dynamics of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in intensive care units and SARS-CoV-2 in hospitals and secondary schools. Before joining the University of Utah, I was a postdoctoral research fellow at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, where my work focused on understanding the relationship between antibiotic use and antibiotic resistance in hospital-associated pathogens.

Outside of research, I enjoy climbing, hiking, running, discussion nights, and Lindy Hop. I’m drawn to community-centered projects, thoughtful conversations, and work that feels grounded in care for others.
